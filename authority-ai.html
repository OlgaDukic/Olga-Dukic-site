    <h1 class="mb-4">Will Artificial Intelligence Become the Next Educational Authority?</h1>

    <p>Learning is changing rapidly. Models like ChatGPT, Claude, and others are already assisting students and teachers. But a serious question arises: who will tomorrow’s student trust more — a teacher or an algorithm?</p>

    <p>AI doesn’t hold a grade book. It doesn’t know a student’s context or personality. But it offers fast, precise, and often technically correct answers. That precision can feel like certainty. And certainty builds authority.</p>

    <p>But what about pedagogy? Empathy? The human dimension that defines a great teacher?</p>

    <p>Modern education shouldn’t become a competition between humans and machines. It must become collaboration. A teacher who uses AI as a tool, not a replacement. A student who knows when to ask the machine — and when to ask a person. A parent who sees the value in both.</p>

    <p>The future will bring change, no doubt. But the real questions are:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Who will set the rules for AI in classrooms?</li>
      <li>Will teachers be supported to prepare for this?</li>
      <li>Do students know what’s reliable and what’s not?</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Authority isn’t earned through speed. It’s earned through trust. Now is the time to ensure we don’t lose that trust.</p>

    <p><strong>Because the future of learning doesn’t belong to humans or machines — it belongs to those who can connect them.</strong></p>
